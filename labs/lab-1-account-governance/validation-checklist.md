    - Confirm report delivery is scheduled

## End-to-End Validation Test

Perform these tests to validate your implementation works as expected:

- [ ] **Test IAM password policy**
  - Create a test IAM user with a password that doesn't meet requirements
  - Expected result: Creation should fail

- [ ] **Test CloudTrail logging**
  - Make a permissions change (create/delete a test policy)
  - Wait 15 minutes
  - Check CloudTrail for the event
  - Expected result: Event should be logged

- [ ] **Test CloudWatch alarm**
  - Temporarily log in as root user (with MFA)
  - Wait for alarm to trigger
  - Expected result: Should receive an email alert

- [ ] **Test AWS Config rule**
  - Create a test S3 bucket with public write access
  - Wait 15-30 minutes
  - Check AWS Config
  - Expected result: Should show a compliance failure

- [ ] **Test Security Hub**
  - Review Security Hub dashboard
  - Expected result: Should show improved security score following implementations

- [ ] **Test Budget alert** (optional, requires spending money)
  - Deploy a small resource that will trigger a budget alert
  - Expected result: Should receive budget notification

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If any validations fail, refer to these common issues and solutions:

1. **IAM Password Policy not working**
   - Ensure you clicked "Save changes" after configuring policy
   - Try setting policy via AWS CLI to bypass potential console issues

2. **CloudTrail not logging events**
   - Verify trail is enabled for all regions
   - Check S3 bucket permissions
   - Allow up to 15 minutes for events to appear

3. **CloudWatch alarms not triggering**
   - Verify SNS topic subscription was confirmed
   - Check metric filter syntax
   - Ensure alarm threshold is configured correctly

4. **AWS Config rules showing "Evaluating"**
   - Rules can take 30+ minutes to evaluate first time
   - Check IAM permissions for AWS Config service
   - Verify Config recorder is enabled

5. **Security Hub showing incomplete results**
   - Initial scan can take 24+ hours to complete
   - Ensure AWS Config is properly configured
   - Check IAM permissions for Security Hub

## Next Steps After Validation

Once all checks pass:
- [ ] Document your implemented security controls
- [ ] Take screenshots of key configurations for your portfolio
- [ ] Consider implementing the optional challenges in [challenges.md](challenges.md)
- [ ] Progress to [Lab 2: Identity and Access Management](../lab-2-identity-access-management/)

**Note**: Keep this checklist for future reference. It can be used during compliance audits to demonstrate your security controls.
