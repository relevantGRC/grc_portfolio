# Lab 1: AWS Account Governance - Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for implementing AWS account security governance controls following best practices from the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this lab, ensure you have:

- An AWS account with administrator access
- AWS CLI installed and configured on your local machine
- AWS CloudFormation knowledge for deployment
- Basic familiarity with AWS Console navigation

## Estimated Time

- **Complete Lab**: 2-3 hours
- **Module 1**: 30 minutes
- **Module 2**: 45 minutes
- **Module 3**: 45 minutes
- **Module 4**: 30 minutes
- **Module 5**: 15 minutes

## Module 1: IAM Security Foundations

In this module, you'll implement baseline IAM security controls to protect your AWS account.

### Step 1.1: Configure IAM Password Policy

1. Open the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to IAM Service
3. In the left navigation pane, click on "Account settings"
4. Under "Password policy", click "Edit"
5. Configure the following recommended settings:
   - Minimum password length: 14 characters
   - Require at least one uppercase letter
   - Require at least one lowercase letter
   - Require at least one number
   - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character
   - Enable password expiration after 90 days
   - Prevent password reuse (remember last 24 passwords)
6. Click "Save changes"

**Alternatively, using AWS CLI**:

```bash
aws iam update-account-password-policy \
    --minimum-password-length 14 \
    --require-symbols \
    --require-numbers \
    --require-uppercase-characters \
    --require-lowercase-characters \
    --allow-users-to-change-password \
    --max-password-age 90 \
    --password-reuse-prevention 24
```

### Step 1.2: Enable MFA for Root User

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user
2. In the navigation bar, click on your account name, then "Security credentials"
3. In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, click "Assign MFA device"
4. Choose your preferred MFA device type (Virtual, Security Key, or Hardware)
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup
6. Verify that MFA status shows "Assigned" for your root user

**Important**: Store your MFA device and backup codes securely. Losing access to your MFA device without backup recovery options could lock you out of your account.

### Step 1.3: Create an IAM Admin User

1. Navigate to IAM Service
2. Click "Users" in the left navigation pane
3. Click "Create user"
4. Enter a username (e.g., "AdminUser")
5. Select "Provide user access to the AWS Management Console"
6. Select "I want to create an IAM user"
7. Set a custom password and uncheck "Users must create a new password at next sign-in"
8. Click "Next"
9. Select "Attach policies directly"
10. Search for and select "AdministratorAccess"
11. Click "Next", review the details, and click "Create user"
12. Set up MFA for this admin user by selecting the user, going to the "Security credentials" tab, and clicking "Assign MFA device"

### Step 1.4: Set up IAM Access Analyzer

1. Navigate to IAM Service
2. Click "Access analyzer" in the left navigation pane
3. Click "Create analyzer"
4. Set "Analyzer name" to "AccountAnalyzer"
5. For "Zone of trust", select "Current account"
6. Click "Create analyzer"

## Module 2: Logging and Monitoring Setup

In this module, you'll implement comprehensive logging and monitoring controls.

### Step 2.1: Configure CloudTrail

1. Navigate to CloudTrail service
2. Click "Create trail"
3. Set "Trail name" to "AccountTrail"
4. Under "Storage location", choose "Create new S3 bucket"
5. Set a unique bucket name (e.g., "accounttrail-logs-[account-id]")
6. Under "Additional settings":
   - Enable "Log file validation"
   - Enable "Enable for all accounts in my organization" if using AWS Organizations
   - Enable SSE-KMS encryption and choose "Create a new KMS key"
   - Set key alias to "cloudtrail-key"
7. Under "Additional configuration":
   - Select "Management events"
   - Select "All" for Read and Write events
   - Enable "Insights events" for enhanced monitoring
8. Click "Next" and then "Create trail"

### Step 2.2: Set up CloudWatch Alarms for CloudTrail

1. Navigate to CloudWatch service
2. Click "Alarms" in the left navigation pane
3. Click "Create alarm"
4. Click "Select metric"
5. Select "CloudTrail" > "By Trail Name"
6. Select your trail and the "Management events" metric
7. Click "Select metric"
8. Set the threshold to "Static", "Greater/Equal", and enter "1" as the value
9. Click "Next"
10. For alarm state, choose "In alarm"
11. Create a new SNS topic named "SecurityAlerts"
12. Add your email address as a notification target
13. Click "Create topic"
14. Click "Next", set name to "CloudTrailChangesAlarm"
15. Click "Create alarm"
16. Confirm the subscription in the email you receive

### Step 2.3: Create Key CloudWatch Alarms

Repeat the process to create the following essential security alarms:

1. **Root Login Alarm**:
   - Metric: CloudTrail metric filter for "$.userIdentity.type = Root"
   - Alarm: Trigger when ≥ 1

2. **IAM Policy Changes Alarm**:
   - Metric: CloudTrail metric filter for IAM policy changes
   - Alarm: Trigger when ≥ 1

3. **Console Login Failures Alarm**:

## Module 5: Cost Controls and Budget Alerts

In this module, you'll implement cost management controls.

### Step 5.1: Set up AWS Budgets

1. Navigate to AWS Budgets (via AWS Cost Management)
2. Click "Create budget"
3. Select "Use a template" and choose "Monthly cost budget"
4. Set a realistic budget amount based on your expected usage
5. Configure alerts at 50%, 80%, and 100% of your budget
6. Add email recipients for the alerts
7. Click "Create budget"

### Step 5.2: Configure Cost Explorer

1. Navigate to Cost Explorer
2. Enable Cost Explorer if not already enabled
3. Create saved reports for:
   - Monthly costs by service
   - Costs by tag (once you've implemented tagging)
4. Schedule these reports to be emailed monthly

## Validation and Testing

After completing all modules, perform the following validation tests:

1. **IAM Password Policy**: Attempt to create a user with a weak password (should fail)
2. **MFA**: Attempt to access the console without MFA (should require MFA)
3. **CloudTrail**: Make a test API call and verify it appears in CloudTrail logs
4. **CloudWatch Alarms**: Trigger a test alarm to verify notifications
5. **AWS Config**: Make a change that violates a rule and verify that Config detects it
6. **Security Hub**: Review findings and verify that controls are properly evaluating
7. **Budgets**: Verify that budget alerts are properly configured

## Clean-up Instructions

If you deployed this lab for learning purposes and wish to avoid ongoing charges:

1. **AWS Config**: Turn off AWS Config recording
2. **CloudTrail**: Delete the CloudTrail trail
3. **S3**: Empty and delete the CloudTrail and Config S3 buckets
4. **CloudWatch**: Delete the CloudWatch alarms
5. **SNS**: Delete the SNS topics
6. **Security Hub**: Disable Security Hub

**Note**: Only perform these clean-up steps if you're sure you no longer need these security controls. In a production environment, these controls should remain enabled.

## Next Steps

After completing this lab, consider:

1. Enabling additional security services like Amazon GuardDuty for threat detection
2. Implementing more comprehensive tagging strategies for resource management
3. Setting up more detailed monitoring and alerting
4. Proceeding to [Lab 2: Identity and Access Management](../lab-2-identity-access-management/) to build on these security foundations
