# Lab 1: AWS Account Governance - Assessment Worksheet

Use this worksheet to evaluate your implementation of the AWS Account Governance controls and reflect on your experience. This will help you document your work for your GRC portfolio.

## Implementation Assessment

### Core Security Controls

Check off each control as you verify its implementation:

| Security Control | Implemented | Notes/Evidence |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| IAM Password Policy | □ | |
| Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | □ | |
| CloudTrail with Multi-Region Logging | □ | |
| CloudTrail S3 Bucket (encrypted, access-controlled) | □ | |
| AWS Config Recorder | □ | |
| AWS Config Rules | □ | |
| Security Hub | □ | |
| IAM Access Analyzer | □ | |
| CloudWatch Alarms for Security Events | □ | |
| SNS Topic for Alerts | □ | |
| AWS Budget with Notifications | □ | |

### AWS Config Rule Compliance

List the AWS Config rules you've implemented and their compliance status:

| Rule Name | Compliance Status | Non-Compliant Resources |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| | | |
