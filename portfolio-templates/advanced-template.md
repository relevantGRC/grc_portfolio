## Advanced Security Implementations

### Automated Security Compliance Framework

**Overview**: Designed and implemented an automated security compliance framework that continuously monitors, remediates, and reports on compliance posture across multiple AWS accounts.

**Technical Components**:
- AWS Config with custom rules aligned to multiple compliance frameworks
- Automated remediation using AWS Lambda and Systems Manager
- Centralized compliance dashboard using AWS Security Hub and QuickSight
- Evidence collection automation for audit readiness

**Code Snippet**:
```python
# Example of automated compliance remediation function
def remediate_noncompliant_resource(event, context):
    """AWS Lambda function to automatically remediate non-compliant resources."""
    
    # Extract resource details from AWS Config event
    resource_type = event['detail']['resourceType']
    resource_id = event['detail']['resourceId']
    
    if resource_type == 'AWS::S3::Bucket':
        # Implement S3 bucket remediation
        apply_s3_secure_transport_policy(resource_id)
    elif resource_type == 'AWS::IAM::Role':
        # Implement IAM role remediation
        apply_iam_permission_boundaries(resource_id)
    
    # Log remediation action
    print(f"Remediated {resource_type} with ID {resource_id}")
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': f"Successfully remediated {resource_type}"
    }
```

**Impact**:
- Reduced manual compliance verification effort by 80%
- Decreased compliance drift by implementing continuous monitoring and remediation
- Streamlined audit process with automated evidence collection

### Security Incident Response Automation

**Overview**: Developed an automated incident response capability that detects, contains, and remediates common security incidents with minimal human intervention.

**Technical Components**:
- Amazon GuardDuty for threat detection
- Custom AWS Lambda functions for automated response actions
- Step Functions for orchestrating complex response workflows
- Integration with ticketing and notification systems

**Architecture Diagram**:
```

```

**Impact**:
- Reduced mean time to respond to critical security incidents from hours to minutes
- Automated containment of compromised resources to prevent lateral movement
- Implemented forensic data collection for post-incident analysis
